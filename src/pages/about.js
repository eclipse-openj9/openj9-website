        <Styled.p>
          Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; is a high performance, scalable, Java virtual machine (JVM) implementation that represents hundreds 
          of person-years of effort. Contributed to the Eclipse project by IBM, the OpenJ9 JVM underpins the IBM SDK, Java 
          Technology Edition product that is a core component of many IBM Enterprise software products. Continued development 
          of OpenJ9 at the Eclipse foundation ensures wider collaboration, fresh innovation, and the opportunity to influence 
          the development of OpenJ9 for the next generation of Java applications.

      <Styled.h2>Our supporters</Styled.h2>
      <Styled.p>
        The success of the OpenJ9 project is underpinned by the generosity of our supporters,
        to whom we would like to extend our thanks. This support comes in different forms; monetory,
        people, system, and data center resources. People resources help us to staff the planning, development,
        delivery, and support of OpenJ9 releases as well as pioneering new and innovative technologies.
        Dedicated systems and hosting services allow us to run automated build and test operations,
        which help ensure that quality and reliability is central to all our deliverables.
