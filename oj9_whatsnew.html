          <h3>Eclipse OpenJ9 version 0.11.0 released</h3>
          <p><i>22nd October 2018</i></p>
          <p>Our latest release of Eclipse OpenJ9 is now complete and comes with extended support and performance benefits:
			<p><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #407471;opacity: 0.7; font-size:.9rem"></i> <strong>Support for the MacOS platform</strong></p>
			<p>OpenJDK with OpenJ9 is now available on macOS&reg;. Early builds of OpenJDK 11 with OpenJ9 are now available at the <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/nightly.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=openj9">AdoptOpenJDK project</a>, 
			with OpenJDK 8 coming soon.</p>
			<p><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #407471;opacity: 0.7; font-size:.9rem"></i> <strong>Improved cryptographic performance with support for OpenSSL</strong></p>
			<p>OpenJ9 now supports OpenSSL v1.1.x for native cryptographic operations on OpenJDK 8, providing performance improvements over the default OpenJDK 8 
cryptographic implementation. On x86 Linux, we measured up to a 15x improvement on encrypt and decrypt operations for the GCM and CBC algorithms compared
to the default implmentation.</p>
			<p><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #407471;opacity: 0.7; font-size:.9rem"></i> <strong>Improved performance of AOT compiled code</i></strong></p>
			<p>Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compiled code is ideal for using at startup time, but it is not as fast as JIT-compiled code from a throughput perspective. 
In this release, we have introduced an improved AOT implementation, with better throughput that bridges up to half the performance delta on x86-64 
platforms compared to JIT-compiled code. At the moment, this new AOT implementation can be invoked under the`-Xtune:virtualized` option. There are 
three potential areas of improvement; (i) better startup time (because AOT code runs a lot during the startup phase), 
(ii) faster ramp-up time (where AOT is being used more aggressively under `-Xtune:virtualized`), and (iii) better throughput (for applications that are 
running lots of AOT code during steady state).</p>
			<p><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #407471;opacity: 0.7; font-size:.9rem"></i> <strong>Memory optimizations for applications that run in containers</i></strong></p>
			<p>We recently added some intelligence to make OpenJ9 "container-aware", which allows it to make informed decisions about the
size of your Java heap if you run your application in a container. Since applications are typically run on their own in a container and do 
not need to compete for memory, the JVM allocates a larger proportion of memory for the Java heap. With more container memory available, the JIT compiler
can work harder, improving the ramp up time for applications. Conversely, if we do not have as much container memory available, the JIT compiler can 
reduce its memory usage to fit within the container limits. Due to good performance results and positive feedback, we've now enabled this 
feature by default.</p>
			<p><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #407471;opacity: 0.7; font-size:.9rem"></i> <strong>x86 support for our "pause-less" GC mode for response-time sensitive, large heap applications</strong></p>
			<p>We've now extended support to Linux and Windows 64-bit compressed references OpenJ9 builds for this innovative GC mode (`-Xgc:concurrentScavenge`) that 
runs concurrently with Java application threads. In this mode, the garbage collector is able to relocate objects while application threads are running, 
thereby reducing the "stop-the-world" application pause time needed to reclaim memory on the Java heap. Shorter pause times mean faster response times. 
So if you're running an app that requires a large Java heap but depends on fast response-times, why not try it out?</p>

          <h3>Eclipse OpenJ9 version 0.10.0 released</h3>
          <p><i>3rd October 2018</i></p>
          <p>Eclipse OpenJ9 version 0.10.0 adds support for OpenJDK version 11. All the testing we've done so far proves
		  that builds are compatible with OpenJDK 11 and builds are now available at  <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=openj9" target="_blank">AdoptOpenJDK</a>.</p>
		  
		  <p>To learn more about our release strategy, plus our supported architectures and operating systems, 
		  see <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs/openj9_support/index.html">Supported environments</a>.</p>

		  <p>To help users adopt OpenJ9 we have been busy adding compatibility for a number of Hotspot options. We 
		  are also writing content for the user documentation to help you compare Hotspot and OpenJ9 non-standard options and 
		  garbage collection policies. So if you haven't already tried an OpenJDK with OpenJ9 or you've stumbled into problems 
		  because command-line options you are familiar with are not recognised, we're working hard to improve the experience. If
		  you have a migration problem, please help us out by posting details in a GitHub <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/issues/2332">issue</a>.
		  </p>

          <h3>Eclipse OpenJ9 version 0.9.0 released</h3>
          <p><i>15th August 2018</i></p>
          <p>We're pleased to announce the release of Eclipse OpenJ9 version 0.9.0.</p>
		  <p>V0.9.0 adds support for OpenJDK 10 builds, OpenJDK 8 Windows 32-bit builds, and OpenJDK large heap builds 
		  that support Java heap sizes > 57 GB.
		  Work is underway to make these builds available at  <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net" target="_blank">AdoptOpenJDK</a>. 
		  If you want a large heap binary for a platform other than 
		  <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/nightly.html?variant=openjdk8-openj9" target="_blank">OpenJDK 8 
		  Linux x64</a><i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #407471;opacity: 0.7; font-size:.9rem"></i>, 
		  you can easily build one by following our <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/tree/master/buildenv" target="_blank">
		  detailed build instructions</a><i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #407471;opacity: 0.7; font-size:.9rem"></i>. 
	      To learn more about our release strategy, plus our supported architectures and operating systems, 
		see <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs/openj9_support/index.html">Supported environments</a>.</p>

		  <p>Version 0.9.0 also includes some great progress to make the JVM more container-aware. When OpenJ9 is running 
		  inside a container, checks for memory availability and subsequent Java heap allocation now reflect limits 
		  that are imposed on the container. You can read more about our enhancement plans and progress around 
		  container technology in <a href="https://blog.openj9.org/2018/06/12/eclipse-openj9-in-containers/" target="_blank">Eclipse 
		  OpenJ9 in Containers</a><i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #407471;opacity: 0.7; font-size:.9rem"></i>. </p> 
		
		<p>We are also introducing a new garbage collection policy mode to implement <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/318" target="_blank">JEP 318</a>
		<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #407471;opacity: 0.7; font-size:.9rem"></i>.
		When this policy is enabled (<strong>-Xgcpolicy:nogc</strong> or <strong>-XX:+UseNoGC</strong>), the Java 
		object heap is expanded in the normal way until the limit is reached, but memory is not reclaimed through 
		garbage collection. This mode is ideal for short-lived applications and useful for test purposes.</p>
		
		<p>To read about other enhancements and notable changes in this release, see our <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs/version0.9/"><i>What's new</i></a> topic. 
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>If you are interested in trying the OpenJDK 8 Windows binaries, we've run some Eclipse performance tests to compare OpenJ9 and the Hotspot JVM.
		Our results indicate that OpenJ9 is <strong>43% faster</strong> and uses <strong>42% less memory</strong>. Read more about these amazing results
		in <a href="https://blog.openj9.org/2018/06/15/eclipse-openj9-performance-a-bake-off-on-windows/" target="_blank">Eclipse OpenJ9; a
		bake off on Windows</a><i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #407471;opacity: 0.7; font-size:.9rem"></i>. 
		In fact, the results are so impressive that the Eclipse Foundation have decided to bundle
		OpenJ9 with a future release of the Eclipse IDE.</p>

		  
		  <p>On a final note, <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs/">user documentation</a> is now available to support the configuration, tuning, and diagnosis of JDKs that contain the
		OpenJ9 JVM. Expect the content here to grow over time as more information is written about our JIT compiler, 
		garbage collectors, shared classes cache implementation, and diagnostic capabilities.</p>

          <p><i>19th March 2018</i></p>
          <p>We've already demonstrated the performance advantages of OpenJDK 9 with OpenJ9, but you might be wondering what you get with OpenJDK 8. So we have taken the opportunity to re-evaluate the performance of OpenJ9 when running OpenJDK 8, using the same metrics as we used when we tested OpenJDK 9.
          </p>
          <p>OpenJDK 8 with OpenJ9 resulted in a <b>42% faster startup</b> and a <b>footprint at least 60% smaller</b>, than OpenJDK 8 with HotSpot: results that are very much in line with our previous tests.
          </p>
          <p>You can see the full range of tests and their results on the updated <a href="oj9_performance.html">Performance</a> page.

          <h3>Eclipse OpenJ9 for Java&trade; 8</h3>
          <p><i>22nd November 2017</i></p>
          <p>Over the last couple of months, we've been talking about OpenJ9 with pretty much everyone who'd listen to us. People have told us that OpenJ9 for Java 9 is a great achievement, but many users and developers aren't ready to step up to Java 9 just yet. The most popular request we've heard is to combine Eclipse OpenJ9 with a Java 8 JDK so that it can be used in day-to-day development and production environments.
          </p>
          <p>We heard that feedback loud and clear, and the Eclipse OpenJ9 community has been working hard to make it a reality!
          </p>
          <p>The OpenJ9 project is proud to announce that you can now build OpenJDK8 with Eclipse OpenJ9. Downloadable binaries are already available at the AdoptOpenJDK project:
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:center;"><a class="button external-button" style="width:15em; margin-top:0rem;" href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/nightly.html?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=openj9">Download binaries here <i class="fa fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
          </p>
          <p>If you want to build OpenJDK8 with OpenJ9 yourself, you can follow the instructions on our <a href="oj9_build.html">build page</a>. Right now, you can build it for Linux on x86-64, ppc64le, s390x, and AIX. More platforms to follow!
          </p>
          <p>Did we already tell you that the Eclipse OpenJ9 project uses a single code stream to implement the JVM across all supported Java releases, from Java 8 to Java 9 and beyond? That means users should get the same excellent performance, features, and new processor support from OpenJ9 no matter which Java level you're using to run your applications.
          </p>
          <p>Interested in what performance you can expect for OpenJDK8 with OpenJ9? The data is not on our website 
          at the moment, but for applications we've tried, OpenJDK8 with OpenJ9 performs the same or better than 
          OpenJDK9 with OpenJ9. If you haven't seen the impressive results for OpenJDK9 yet, pop over to our <a href="oj9_performance.html">performance page</a>.
          </p>
          <p>We're really excited to bring you Java 8 support, and we hope you'll take it for a test drive. 
          We think it will be a great experience for you. Good or bad, let us know how it goes! 
          You can connect with us via <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/issues">GitHub issues</a> or 
          on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%23OpenJ9">stackoverflow</a> using the <code class="stack">#OpenJ9</code> tag. 
          We look forward to hearing from you!
